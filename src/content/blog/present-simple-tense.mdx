# Understanding Present Simple Tense

The **present simple tense** is one of the most fundamental tenses in English. It's used to describe habits, facts, and general truths.

## When to Use Present Simple

### 1. Habits and Routines

We use present simple to talk about things we do regularly:

<div class="example-box">
  - I **drink** coffee every morning. - She **works** from 9 to 5. - They
  **play** soccer on weekends.
</div>

### 2. Facts and General Truths

Present simple describes things that are always true:

<div class="example-box">
  - The sun **rises** in the east. - Water **boils** at 100¬∞C. - Cats **sleep**
  a lot.
</div>

### 3. Permanent Situations

For things that don't change often:

<div class="example-box">
  - I **live** in New York. - She **teaches** English. - We **own** a small
  business.
</div>

## How to Form Present Simple

### Positive Form

| Subject       | Verb        | Example       |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| I/You/We/They | base form   | I **work**    |
| He/She/It     | base + s/es | She **works** |

<div class="tip">
  üí° **Tip:** Remember to add 's' or 'es' to verbs when the subject is he, she,
  or it!
</div>

### Negative Form

Use **don't** (do not) or **doesn't** (does not):

<div class="example-box">
  - I **don't like** spicy food. - He **doesn't speak** French. - They **don't
  have** a car.
</div>

### Question Form

Use **do** or **does** at the beginning:

<div class="example-box">
  - **Do** you like pizza? - **Does** she work here? - **Do** they have
  children?
</div>

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

<div class="warning">
  ‚ö†Ô∏è **Don't forget the 's'!** - ‚ùå He work every day. - ‚úÖ He work**s** every
  day.
</div>

<div class="warning">
  ‚ö†Ô∏è **Don't use 'do/does' with 'be':** - ‚ùå Do you are happy? - ‚úÖ Are you
  happy?
</div>

These words often go with present simple:

- **always**, **usually**, **often**, **sometimes**, **rarely**, **never**
- **every day/week/month/year**
- **on Mondays/weekends**
- **in the morning/afternoon/evening**
