## What Are Daily Routines?

Daily routines are things we do every day at regular times. We use the **present simple tense** to talk about these regular activities.

<div class="tip-box">
  üí° **Remember:** In present simple, we add -s or -es to verbs when talking
  about he/she/it. - I wake up at 7 AM - She wake**s** up at 7 AM
</div>

## Morning Routine Vocabulary

Let's start with common morning activities:

<div class="vocabulary-box">
  **Morning Activities:** - **wake up** - open your eyes and stop sleeping -
  **get up** - leave your bed - **brush teeth** - clean your teeth with a
  toothbrush - **take a shower** - wash your body with water - **get dressed** -
  put on clothes - **have breakfast** - eat your first meal of the day

  ]}
  hint="Remember to add -s for he/she/it!"
  id="daily-routine-blanks"
/>

## Time Expressions

We often use these time expressions with daily routines:

<div class="vocabulary-box">
  **Frequency Words:** - **always** (100%) - "I always brush my teeth" -
  **usually** (90%) - "She usually has coffee for breakfast" - **often** (70%) -
  "We often watch TV in the evening" - **sometimes** (50%) - "He sometimes reads
  before bed" - **rarely** (10%) - "They rarely eat fast food" - **never** (0%)
  - "I never skip breakfast"
</div>

<QuizComponent
  question="Where do frequency adverbs usually go in a sentence?"
  options={[
    "At the end of the sentence",
    "Before the main verb",
    "At the beginning of the sentence",
    "After the object",
  ]}
  correct={1}
  explanation="Frequency adverbs (always, usually, often, etc.) go before the main verb: 'I always eat breakfast' or 'She never skips lunch.'"
  id="frequency-quiz"
/>

## Evening Routines

<div class="example-box">
  **Common Evening Activities:** - **come home** - return to your house - **have
  dinner** - eat your evening meal - **watch TV** - look at television programs
  - **do homework** - complete school assignments - **read a book** - look at
  and understand written words - **go to bed** - lie down to sleep
</div>

<MatchingGame

  words={[
    {
      word: "come home",
      translation: "return to house",
      example: "I come home at 6 PM every day.",
    },
    {
      word: "have dinner",
      translation: "eat evening meal",
      example: "We have dinner together as a family.",
    },
    {
      word: "watch TV",
      translation: "look at television",
      example: "She watches TV for one hour before bed.",
    },
    {
      word: "do homework",
      translation: "study at home",
      example: "He does homework right after dinner.",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Real-Life Practice

Now let's practice talking about YOUR daily routine!

<div class="exercise-box">
**Speaking Practice:**
Try to say these sentences about yourself:
1. "I wake up at _____ every morning."
2. "I usually have _____ for breakfast."
3. "I go to work/school at _____."
4. "In the evening, I often _____."
5. "I always _____ before bed."

**Example:** "I wake up at 7 AM every morning. I usually have cereal for breakfast. I go to school at 8:30 AM. In the evening, I often watch Netflix. I always brush my teeth before bed."

</div>

<QuizComponent
  question="Complete the sentence: 'Every Sunday, my family _____ to church.'"
  options={["go", "goes", "going", "are go"]}
  correct={0}
  explanation="'My family' is plural, so we use 'go' (not 'goes'). We don't add -s to plural subjects."
  id="family-quiz"
/>

## Weekend vs Weekday Routines

Many people have different routines on weekends!

<div class="tip-box">
**Weekday Routine:** More structured, early wake-up, work/school
**Weekend Routine:** More relaxed, sleep in, leisure activities

**Example:**

- Weekdays: "I wake up at 6:30 AM."
- Weekends: "I sleep until 9 AM."

</div>

<FillBlanksComponent
  sentence="On weekdays, Tom gets up early and hurries to work. On weekends, he sleeps late and relaxes at home."
  blanks={[
    { word: "gets", options: ["get", "gets", "getting"] },
    { word: "hurries", options: ["hurry", "hurries", "hurrying"] },
    { word: "sleeps", options: ["sleep", "sleeps", "sleeping"] },
    { word: "relaxes", options: ["relax", "relaxes", "relaxing"] },
  ]}
  hint="Remember: he/she/it needs -s or -es!"
  id="weekend-routine-blanks"
/>

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

<div class="warning">
‚ùå **Don't say:** "She don't like breakfast"  
‚úÖ **Say:** "She doesn't like breakfast"

‚ùå **Don't say:** "Do she wake up early?"  
‚úÖ **Say:** "Does she wake up early?"

‚ùå **Don't say:** "I am wake up at 7 AM"  
‚úÖ **Say:** "I wake up at 7 AM"

    "Does you go to school every day?",

  ]}
  correct={2}
  explanation="Use 'Do' with you/I/we/they and 'Does' with he/she/it. The main verb stays in base form."
  id="question-form-quiz"
/>

## üéµ Pronunciation Practice

    },
    {

      correctOption: 1,
