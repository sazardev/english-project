## Meeting Language Patterns

<div class="example-box">

    "That's a terrible idea!",
    "I see your point, however, I have some concerns.",
    "No way, I don't agree.",
  ]}
  correct={2}
  explanation="Professional disagreement requires diplomatic language. 'I see your point, however...' acknowledges the other person's view before presenting your own."

## 💬 Interactive Meeting Simulation

Experience a real quarterly review meeting! Make professional choices and practice business communication.

<InteractiveDialogue
  scenario="You're attending a quarterly review meeting at TechCorp Inc. The team is discussing the performance of the new mobile app launch."

        "...tell you that we had big problems.",
        "...mention that the team worked good.",
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation:

        "Why didn't you fix this earlier?",
        "Technical problems are normal, right?",
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation:
        "'Could you elaborate on...' is professional language for requesting more information. It shows interest without being accusatory.",

      text: "Could you elaborate on the nature of these technical challenges?",
    },
    {

        "...and fixed everything immediately.",
        "...and implemented a comprehensive solution within 72 hours.",
